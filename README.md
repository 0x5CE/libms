# Important
It is certainly not meant to be a world-changing idea or a working library management system.  Rather, it is meant to be a demo demonstrating things we learned in FoCP course and possiblities of a C system using elementary data structures like linked lists, binary file handling and data storage, networked system, and modern GUI using CGI-BIN.

# About
LibMS (Library Management System) is a C and HTML/CSS application that combines a language as old as C with a modern, catchy interface.  It was my end-semester group project in my freshman year.  I was the team leader. 

# Software and Technologies Used
GCC (compiler), gedit (text editor), apache (web server), CGI-BIN (for web interfacing), C (back-end language), HTML/CSS (front-end language).
